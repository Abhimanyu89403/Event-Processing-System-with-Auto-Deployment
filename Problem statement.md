Project: "Event Processing System with Auto Deployment"
🔥 Overview:
Users upload event data (JSON files) to an S3 bucket.

When a file is uploaded, AWS Lambda triggers:

Validates the data.

Stores a record into a Database (let’s use RDS MySQL).

Meanwhile, a Dockerized application is running on an EC2 instance, pulling validated data from the database and showing it on a simple dashboard.

Ansible automates setting up the EC2 (install Docker, deploy the app).

GitHub stores your infrastructure-as-code (Ansible playbooks, Dockerfile, app source code).

IAM roles manage permissions (S3 read, RDS access, Lambda execution, EC2 access).

🔧 Detailed Components:

Tech	Usage
S3 Bucket	Users upload JSON files with event information.
Lambda	Auto-trigger on S3 upload → validate → insert into RDS.
EC2	Host a small web app (dashboard) running inside Docker container.
Docker	Package the app (Node.js, Python Flask, or simple PHP app).
Ansible	Install Docker on EC2, deploy containerized app, configure environment.
GitHub	Store Ansible playbooks, Dockerfile, app code (CI/CD optional).
IAM Roles	Lambda access to RDS & S3, EC2 access to RDS.
Database	RDS MySQL stores validated event data.
